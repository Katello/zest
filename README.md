Zest is a rubygem api library for communicating with a Pulp 3 Server.  It is autogenerated from Pulp 3's api specification.  

This git repository does not host the library, but instead provides tooling for generating new versions of the gem. 

Zest rubygem build instructions

1.  Setup pulplift: https://github.com/pulp/pulplift.  Git clone the project and follow the Setup instructions in the README
2.  Checkout zest within pulplift, your directory structure should look like:
```
$ ls -l pulplift/
ansible.cfg
ansible-pulp3
forklift
playbooks
README.md
roles
vagrant
Vagrantfile
zest
```

3.  Set the build version, in zest/playbook.yml
4.  Within pulplift, run:
```
ansible-playbook zest/playbook.yml  -e "pulplift_state=up gem_version=0.0.2"
```

This will spinup a pulp3 vagrant box, generate a new zest gem and copy it back to the pulplift directory.

5.  To push to rubygems.org (if you have permissions): 
```
gem push zest-0.0.z.gem
```

6.  Destroy your box:
```
vagrant destroy zest-builder
```
